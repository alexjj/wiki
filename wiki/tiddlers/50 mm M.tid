So many options! [[This chap|https://www.47-degree.com/focus-shift/leica-m-50mm-lens-comparison-part-4]] did a very detailed comparison of 10 50mm lenses.

One that stands out is the Voigtlander Nokton 1.5 II, perhaps a bit heavy on vignetting but otherwise a good all round lens that is compact.

Others to consider that Iâ€™ve seen from reddit or forums which are actual Leica lenses. Be nice to have a Leica lensâ€¦although maybe the 90 could be Leica. The CV are very highly regarded.

* Elmar 2.8
* Summarit 2.5

Or if I want to buy a new lens with ye olde rendering thereâ€™s the new Voigtlander 50mm f/1.5 Heliar Classicâ€¦thereâ€™s also the CV 50mm 3.5 Heliar.

Notes from that:

* 1.4 ASPH ðŸ˜…
* Cron V3
** Nice and small
* Summarit 2.4/2.5 - second best sharpness vs. APO
* Summicron rigid (version 2) for old fashioned portrait
