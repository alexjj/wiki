title: Fast Log Entry
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A nice plain text, fast entry method for logging. As the name would suggest.

e.g.

```
2024-03-08
1023 7.115 g3abc 57 59
1026 m0xyz 55 58
1030 dk1mi dl/al-093     ## SOTA reference
```

It carries forward information, so in the first log I put the frequency of 7.115 MHz and my RST sent is 57 and RST recieved is 59. My next QSO at 10:26 with M0XYZ is on the same frequenxcy and I gave them 55 and recieved 58. Just need to add.

Cloudlog has integration for it.
