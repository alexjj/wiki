Here's a list of ones I like, either as nice for blogs or just fun looking:

* [[PaperCss|https://papercss-hugo-theme.netlify.app/]]
** Main thing is the papercss font. Sort of drawing/handwriting look
* [[Vitae|https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-vitae/]]
** simple, maybe the dates are a bit //too// big?
* [[Tanka|https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-tanka/]]
** Minimal, regular blog. I like the code rendering and uses Utterances for comments (which is simple to setup and maintain but maybe not handy for readers, although given I've had about 3 comments ever in 6+ years I shouldn't worry too much...althuogh maybe people were put off by github ðŸ˜…)
* [[Paperesque|https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/paperesque/]]
** I like the side notes and the central column style. The tags page is meh. Has magically image resizing but unless I can bake this into fortresty then I'll probably forget the shortcode. However, a favourite so far.
* [[Neofeed|https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/v2/]]
** Looks awesome, and full of indieweb stuff. More like a personal micro.blog replacement (or maybe theme for that?) not sure it's great for longer posts.
* [[PaperMod|https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod]]
** Nothing special looking but feature rich. Not entirely sure I like the capsule post list on the first page.
* [[Github style|https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/github-style/]]
** A clever design that looks exactly like github
* [[Ink Free|https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/ink-free/]]
** Clean, minimal blog. I like the date style.
** Similar to Vitae above
* [[Devise|https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/devise/]]
** Very minimal
* [[Hugo-theme-console|https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-console/]]
** A linux console theme but quite well done
* [[Origin|https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/origin-hugo-theme/]]
** heavy shadows, nice look. not sure about he menu.

Others still to look at:
