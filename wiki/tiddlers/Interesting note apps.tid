Not sure I have use for them but I liked them:

* [[Clone of notepad.cc|https://github.com/pereorga/minimalist-web-notepad]]
** Just page you can write in, if you remember the URL you can edit it
* Notes n' todos [[Demo|https://lpss.dk/nnt-playground/book1/]], [[Source|https://github.com/larspontoppidan/notesntodos]]
** More of a personal one vs. public
** Use nginx htpasswd to secure
* [[Joplin|https://joplinapp.org/]]
** Self-hosted storage and apps on all devices. Like Bear or Apple Notes but self hosted.
* Writing. [[Source|https://github.com/josephernest/writing]], [[Demo|https://josephernest.github.io/writing/]]
** Write and preview markdown. 
** Saves to .md or .pdf. Seems quick. 
* VS Code in the broswer. [[Source|https://github.com/cdr/code-server]]
** Good tool for iPad development on remote server
* [[Jingo wiki|https://github.com/claudioc/jingo]]
** node.js wiki, uses git as backend, auth via OAith (e.g. github) 
* Outline. [[Source|https://github.com/outline/outline]]. [[Hosted version|https://www.getoutline.com/]].
** Not an outliner
** Seems better for documentation.
