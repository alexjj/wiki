Shortlist:

* Station
** Latest 60335
** Older 60050
* Passenger trains
** Another modern passenger 60337 to get a full train
** Previous passenger train, 60197 looks nice but I already have the modern one
** [[MOC based|https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-160680/Andy%20Ps%20Bricks/class-159-3-carriage-dmu-train-in-network-southeast-livery/#details]] upon old trains from when I was a kid
* Cargo options
** Maersk - because it's cool but price. 10219
*** Alternative is just white containers and then some [[stickers|https://www.brickstickershop.com/]] (could do docker containers ðŸ˜…)
*** [[MOC build|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-M33HHMLeo]] and [[instructions |https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VqVJ335fz4]]to make big parts list
** 60052 includes a nice overhead loading arm
** Freight train - available now, and I like the look of all the carriages
** Cheap [[box car|https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-178873/BatteryPoweredBricks/simple-boxcar/#details]] and [[gondola designs|https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-178875/BatteryPoweredBricks/simple-long-gondola-wagon/#details]].
