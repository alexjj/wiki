The second gen Leica after the M3. Mine is from 1962. It’s pretty heavy but a classic, manual camera. Bought 27th July 2021.

Wanted 35mm as all my other film cameras are 50 mm or above. Eventually settled on the V2 of the CV Nokton. 

I like the feel of it when using it and the rangefinder patch, the view lines and the viewfinder itself are all very bright and clear. I like the single frame lines. 35, 50, 90mm seem like a good choice.

The only downsides are (a) no light meter, (b) it’s a bit heavy (c) value. (b) I’ll get used to, and it’s not that bad, (a) can be fixed with an external meter. I use my phone but that’s annoying. I think a hot shoe one is probably best, as keeps my hands free but I think it’ll stick out like a sore thumb. A separate one might be more useful overall. (c), well that’s harder. I think the longer I have it the less likely it is I’ll just turn around and sell it. There aren’t many options for film rangefinders, so it is what it is. I tried a Canon 7 but it was too angular and still a chonker. Probably I’d have got used to it, and “could’ve bought a whole host of lenses and miles of film” for my one lens camera. Maybe I should just buy it as well 😅

I like the wear by the film rewind, shows this camera has had many rolls put through it over the years. It also came with some old looking Ektar film.
