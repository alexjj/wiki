title: New server storage arrangement
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Migrating to the new server, from zfs array to 2x 4TB SSDs. I don't want to merge the SSDs as without redundancy then if one fails everything is gone. So I'm just going to have two drives mounted. Makes things a bit of a hassle. So trying to work out the best arrangement of files.

!!! Existing:

```

* ben is friend's backup and that can stay on the old server.
* computer is mostly docker container data which is moving to the OS drive NVME.
* Photos are also moving to the nvme - although might keep on SSD for ease of samba share (or both for maximum backup ðŸ˜…)

!!! New Setup

* SSD 1 - `data`
** books
** computer
** docs
** games
** music
** photos
** victoria
** videos
* SSD 2 - `media`
** tv - 826gb
** movies - 1.7 tb
** downloads - temp storage

Seems okay so far. SSD 2 is about 2.5 TB out of 3.6 TB actual. Keeps things neat. SSD 1 has a lot of space but that's fine. Think I'm going to keep music on #1 as that's mostly just backup of CDs and never gets played, but maybe useful to be accessed via samba share. It's not that big so maybe could go either place.
