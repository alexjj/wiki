!!! Ways to take it

# Annuity
# Drawdown
# UFPLS


!!!! Annuity

Buy a guarenteed income - give the risk to the provider but all cash gone when you die.

!!!! Drawdown

Have a draw down account that you take some money from pension into drawdown. Could choose to take 25% as tax free, the rest sits in drawdown account. Crystallises all the funds moved. From the drawdown account can draw a taxable income until it's gone and then can repeat process. Crystallising portions as you go.

Drawdown can take income as and when need it. Doing it in stages allows to take lump sums whilst the rest grows. Useful as pension funds are outside estate from inheritance tax purposes, so can pass it on without tax.

Cost of drawdown accounts.

!!!! UFPLS

Uncrystallised Fund Pension Lump Sum ðŸ˜…

Take money straight from pension into bank account. 25% tax free, 75% taxable. Simple option, without setting up drawdown account.

Take ad-hoc as and when needed. e.g. if have other incomes and only need to take lump sums occasionally, then can save the hassle/cost of managing a drawdown account.


!!!! Combo

e.g. Could have a guarenteed small income with an annuity then top up with UFPLS. 

!!! When you die (Death Benefits)
