Small, nice camera. Much more pocketable than X100 series.

Oh look...[[now I can choose 40mm eq...|http://news.ricoh-imaging.co.jp/rim_info2/2021/20210908_031102.html]] So now what...choose this one? tbh I was slightly worried about the 18mm lens on the GRIII when I've been using the 23mm for so long. This ~27mm one is probably better for me. Just it's Â£100 more than the GRIII...
