* Fill barrel 3/4 full
* One tablespoon of grit per lb rating of barrel
* If you can't feel grit, then there's none left!
* Water filled to just below the top, maybe 1/2", don't want to cover the rocks
* Polish - 1 micron or 14,000 grit
* Ceramic media is better than plastic, and makes the grit better and use mixed sizes or large or small. First time get them run them for 2 days with 220 grit to take off sharp edges.
* Keep rocks wet so that grit stuck in cracks doesn't set.
