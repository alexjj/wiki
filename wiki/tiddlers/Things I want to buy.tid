title: Things I want to buy
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

No matter when I think Iâ€™m done it always turns out that thereâ€™s more things I want to buy. Often waiting a while helps weed out the fleeting desires from the good buys. I think writing it down also helps make me really consider if I need it. I do find the journey is more fun than the destination: the research and planning outshines the actual item. So in no particularly order: (perhaps there should be one)

* ~~A [[50 mm M]] mount lens~~
** Bought a lux, it's off for repair and maybe I'll sell it and get something cheaper or not at all. I like 35mm.
* ~~A [[90 mm M]] mount lens~~ [[Leica 90mm Tele-Elmarit]]
* ~~A light meter - maybe shoe mount like keks or handheld.~~ Bought the [[Hedeco Lime One]]
* Fuji 70-300
* Fuji 56 mm
* ~~A macro lens for film scanning, maybe Fuji 60 mm, 80 mm or the 3rd party one Lâ€¦ for Fuji. ~~ bought the 60mm.
* Something to replace the repeatedly failing X100F, once I get it repaired and sold. Maybe X100V or small ICL body. X-E series? Leica CL?
** Replaced with X-E4
* ~~Leica R5 and Leica Elmarit-R 28mm F/2.8~~
** Not sure about this. Not interested in SLR.
* Mac mini m1â€¦although canâ€™t be too far away from M2 or whateverâ€™s next nowâ€¦to replace the old [[desktop|Desktop]]. Plus Mac keyboard and trackpad to go with it. 
** ~~Bought the [[Mac Mini]]~~
** Sold the mac mini.
* New monitors - not sure what, depends on setup. Certainly low on list. 
* Wireless headset - I fear itâ€™ll be hard with glasses other than buying and returning many brands. 
* ~~Stuff to develop film, at least B&W to start with~~ bought just about everything for this. 
* ~~Scanner for said developed film. Canâ€™t decide if Iâ€™m just going to do 35 mm or if Iâ€™ll want to go larger. In which case maybe go to DSLR scanning? Need a copy stand thing, light box and film holder for that then.~~ went DSLR
* ~~Concept2 rower~~
** Bought...need to use it more ðŸ™„
* ~~A new TV so then old one will go in garage for rowing~~ mum gave us their old one. Wouldn't have one for garage but rather get new monitor and move an old one out there.
* A boatload of film 
** It's stupidly expensive nowadays. Least colour is.
* ~~Those expensive Kodak 35 mm film holders~~
** Got for christmas 2022
* ~~New server~~
** Bought
* ~~New Desktop~~
** Bought
* Q2M
* ~~[[Leica M10]]~~
** Bought and returned. No longer want.

Thatâ€™s just what springs to mind at the moment. I should write and add up the total for this ðŸ¤‘

Least Iâ€™m not bothered about phones or carsâ€¦
