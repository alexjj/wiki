Does have G90 config but one guy didn't find it would work well.

Another person set fake it on.

Audio tab, chose input and output of the audio device. Use mono or left.

If see the slider on left as red, then cut microphone input until stop being red. Turn audio output up as high as possible to get ALC to 95-100%, aim for 99% (?)
