title: "Why do I want to work here?"
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This old chesnut! How about the following the answer it:

# Express your personal passion for the employerâ€™s product/service/mission.
# Explain why you would enjoy the responsibilities of the role.
# Describe how you can see yourself succeeding in the role, given your skills and experience.

Be sure to explain //why// to all these items, not just that you are!
